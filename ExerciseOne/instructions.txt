- You will NOT need to add any new text, images, or content to get this page to work.
- You will NOT need to add any CSS within the <style> tag.
- In the image, the tab has a title, which is the title of the page.  Please make sure this shows up as well.
- This exercise focuses on:
    - understanding what belongs in the <head> tag
    - proper indentation of all HTML tags
    - understanding what tags belong as children to any given HTML element
    - making sure that all tags having closing and end tags, and that they properly align
    - if something is not styled in the way you expect, make sure the correct class or classes are attached to the HTML element
- To indent or un-indent an entire block of code to the left or right, do not do each line one-by-one.  Instead, simply highlight the entire block and then...
    1. to un-indent the entire block to the left: hold down SHIFT, and while holding SHIFT, press tab, 
    2. , to tab the entire block to the right: press tab
- If you get stuck and need to re-start, in the terminal use this command
    
    git restore exercise-one.html

    This command reverts your changes in your working directory to what it was before.  You can also find this command when you type "git status" and in the "Changes not staged for commit" list, you will see this as the command to use to discard changes in your working directory.
